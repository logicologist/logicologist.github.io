# Kimberly C. Ruth

I am a first-year PhD student at Stanford University. My research interests are in computer security and privacy.

Previously I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Washington, where I was fortunate to work with Professors Franziska Roesner and Tadayoshi Kohno.
